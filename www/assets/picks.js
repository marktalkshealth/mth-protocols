/* Mark's recommended products ("My Picks"), shown on picks.html.
   To change the shop, edit this one file:
   - STORE_URL: your Amazon storefront link (amazon.com/shop/...). Leave "" to hide the "Visit my Amazon store" button.
   - TAG: your Amazon Associates tracking ID (looks like "marktalks-20"). Added to every link so purchases earn commission.
   - DOMAIN: "www.amazon.com" (US) or "www.amazon.ca" (Canada), etc.
   - Each pick: either an exact product link ("url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/XXXXXXXXXX")
     or, until you've chosen the exact product, a search ("search": "words to search").
   Sections follow the seven pillars. */
